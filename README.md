## Introduction

**RayCeberg** is a game I created in C using the `ncurses` library during my first year of preparatory engineering studies to get familiar with the library and programming in C. The game features a grid of icebergs with different types of fish, and the players are randomly placed on icebergs containing only one normal fish. The players wait for their turns and can move from iceberg to iceberg to collect fishes and increase their score. The game ends when all the players can not move anymore.

## Prerequisites

- **C compiler** such as `gcc` is required to compile the game.
- `ncurses` library to manage the game's terminal-based interface.

## Installation

1. **Install the `ncurses` library with the following command :** 
```sh
sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev libncurses5 libncursesw5
```

2. **Clone the repository :** 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/RayyyZen/RayCeberg.git
```

3. **Move into the project folder :** 
```sh
cd RayCeberg
```

4. **Compile and run the project :**
```sh
make run
```
- **OR**
```sh
make && ./RayCeberg
```

- The chosen iceberg must exist and must not contain any player.
- There must not be any non-existing iceberg or an iceberg with a player on it between the initial iceberg and the chosen iceberg.

The game continues until all players can no longer move. At the end of the game, players are ranked by their scores.
